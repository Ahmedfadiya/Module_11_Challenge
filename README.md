# Predicting search traffic in different time periods for stock trading.

I am tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
I am combining financial Python programming skills with the Time series forecasting.

I created a Jupyter notebook instead of Google Colab that clusters different search traffic in different time periods and then ploted the results so that you can visually see the performance.

The task are:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Step 5: Forecast revenue by using time series models
